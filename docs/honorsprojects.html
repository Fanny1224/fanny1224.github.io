<h1>Honors Project for Electrodynamics Course: Electron Response in Metal</h1>

      In the context of electrodynamics classroom learning, we have conducted a preliminary study on the electromagnetic response behavior of electrons inside metals. On one hand, in the case of electrostatic fields, in order to satisfy the static equilibrium condition, the charge distribution inside an ideal conductor, such as a metal, should be zero. However, in more realistic scenarios, we understand that the surface charge distribution can only be regarded as a mathematical abstraction. In static equilibrium, electrons must necessarily have a finite thickness distribution in the vicinity of the metal surface. Furthermore, if we consider the quantum nature of electrons, they also exhibit tunneling behavior near the surface and have a probability distribution outside the surface. On the other hand, when electromagnetic waves are incident, we have described the response of electrons inside metals to oscillating electric fields using the Drude model in class. We have also derived the effective dielectric constant. However, the Drude model assumes a local response of electrons to external fields, meaning that electrons oscillate under the influence of the electric field at their current position. Additionally, it employs the long-wavelength approximation, neglecting variations in the field at the scale of the electron. Therefore, this model simplifies the force exerted on the actual electrons inside metals to some extent. A more general description should reflect the non-local spatial and temporal response of electrons to the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Hence, the core question addressed in this paper is: How can we re-model the forces acting on electrons inside metals to more accurately describe their response to external electric fields, whether in electrostatic or dynamic situations?</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      In this context, we first adopt the Navier-Stokes equations from fluid mechanics to model the collective behavior of the electron gas inside metals. By combining the equation of state and conservation equations for a zero-temperature Fermi gas, we obtain a complete dynamic description of the electron gas and derive the corresponding constitutive equation. Building upon this foundation, we employ perturbation expansion methods to solve for the charge distribution in a semi-infinite classical system, revealing an effective charge thickness of approximately 0.1nm near the metal surface. Moreover, we discover that due to the presence of the Fermi degeneracy pressure, which depends on the electron density gradient, a longitudinal electromagnetic wave mode similar to "sound waves" exists inside the metal when electromagnetic waves are incident. The constitutive relation allows us to derive the effective dielectric constant for both transverse and longitudinal wave modes of the electron gas inside the metal. We find that the oscillation response of electrons to external fields is local for the transverse wave mode, while it is non-local for the longitudinal wave mode. Specifically, combining Mie theory, we expand the incident and scattered fields in eigenmodes for a special finite system, namely an infinite cylindrical metal, and solve for the behavior of electromagnetic waves scattered by the metal. We observe surface resonance modes caused by local responses and internal resonance modes within the cylinder caused by non-local responses. Finally, to investigate the quantum effects of electrons near the metal surface, we semi-quantitatively self-consistently solve the single-particle Schrödinger equation for electrons in a potential well at the metal surface. We discover an exponential decay of the electron density distribution outside the surface and oscillations in the metal density inside the surface.

        In the study of quantum mechanics, the "algebraic approach" appears repeatedly, which significantly simplifies the process of obtaining all eigenvalues compared to directly solving the Schrödinger equation analytically. However, before employing this method, several questions need to be addressed. Here, the term "algebra" refers to what? Why can we use the "algebraic approach" to solve examples such as the harmonic oscillator potential and angular momentum operators? How are the raising and lowering operators constructed in the process of solving? Is there a general approach? General quantum mechanics textbooks and classroom teachings often do not address these questions directly; instead, they provide the form of the raising and lowering operators and demonstrate their actions on the eigenvalues.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>Therefore, this note attempts to answer the series of questions mentioned above by introducing a range of concepts and examples, elucidating the general structure of the raising and lowering operators corresponding to Lie algebra, and subsequently conducting further operations based on this foundation.</b>

        Modeling traffic flow has been of considerable interest to physicists due to its wide applications. Since cars can be seen as particle systems far from equilibrium, statistical approaches can be utilized to understand traffic flow. To simulate microscopic characteristics of the system, cellular automata (CA) models are widely utilized.
    </p>
    <p>
        Previous models have considered either multilane traffic or inhomogeneous cars. However, very few model has combined them together to give a more comprehensive picture of traffic. <b>Thus, this study sets out to explore a generalized NaSch model with both two factors. The aim of this study is to investigate the macroscopic properties of the generalized model.</b> Three phases, the free fast car phase (FF phase), the Bose-Einstein-like Condensation Phase (BEC phase) and the high-density congested phase (HC phase), are found. Different macroscopic quantities, including entropy, vacancy or platoon length and degeneracy, are defined and investigated in different phases.

        One of the main advantages of Lagrangian mechanics lies in its ability to handle constrained systems. However, in our classroom study, we primarily focused on discussing the solution of dynamic equations involving conservative constraints that do not explicitly depend on velocities. We did not delve further into the general case of constraints or non-holonomic constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here, we focus on the discussion of nonholonomic constraints by introducing the language of differential geometry. We correspond a series of kinematic concepts in configuration space to geometric space, introducing manifold, tangent vectors, tangent space, tangent bundle, flows, and vector fields. We then discuss how to use the Lie bracket and Frobenius theorem to determine whether unique integral curves can be obtained through non-holomonic constraints. We illustrate the application of this approach using the example of a unicycle.
